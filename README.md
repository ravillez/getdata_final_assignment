# getdata_final_assignment
This repository has all the files required for the final assignment in the course "Getting and Cleaning Data" offered by John Hopkins University through Coursera.

The script in the file "run_analyis.R" does the following:

STEP 1: Tidies and merges the test and training data sets.
STEP 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and the standard deviation for each measurement.
STEP 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
STEP 4: Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
STEP 5: Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
